# Corona-News-Website
The website version of a discord bot Corona News. This is my A level project for my Computer Science course at college. It is unfinished, and there are many things that could be improved; with covid difficulties no one in our class finished their A level projects, but I feel I did a good amount.

My A level project report can be found with the link below, where I explain in a *bit*  more detail.
